Methodology 
Agility applies not only in software development, where the process is well-known but also throughout the entire organization to deliver business objectives faster and better. An agile approach allows banks to solve pain points in the client journey in a micro fashion, and to build on any changes incrementally.
After reading multiple research papers and gone though some interviews, this study is considered agile operating model relevance for banking. The main reason is that change in the industry has been accelerating. Banks need to make changes very quickly to their priorities and operating processes. The banking industry is also digitizing very quickly, and increasingly competing with pure digital players. In addition, banks have grown tremendously complex and functionally siloed, especially given regulatory changes and the diversity of channels. Agile is a way of simplifying and creating more accountability at the front-line level.
To enable that type of bold idea and change, we need to be flexible, and organization needs to be able to reconfigure as quickly as it can. And agile allows us to engrain a new culture in the organization, to rewire DNA, to be nimble and customer-centric.
As per of organization flexibility, I would add that talent is an important element as well. Banks realize they need great digital and tech talent, but historically they have not been viewed as fantastic employers for this next generation of talent. Banks need to become less hidebound by processes and policies, less bureaucratic. They should be fun places to work where talented people are empowered, can grow professionally, and are coached for better performance—and these are hallmarks of an agile organization. In the end, an agile organization is composed of a large number of high-performing, small teams, each with a clear mission that they can deliver end to end.

I think agile really adds value when you actually do something that is new, where you need to bring value fast to get customer feedback or ensure your solutions are working appropriately.

Customer-centric agility in development refers to the iterative process of building and testing products, prioritizing the customer's needs and feedback throughout the journey. Unlike the traditional "waterfall" approach that delivers a final product before testing, agile principles enable companies to take a transparent, data-driven approach, continuously testing and learning from the customer's perspective. By embracing agility, organizations can proactively address issues or incorporate changes early in the process, minimizing the impact and avoiding the need to start from scratch. This iterative approach allows for the creation of a minimum viable product (MVP) that aligns with user requirements, ensuring faster time to market and the ability to quickly adapt based on customer insights.

Legacy Systems and Processes: From analysing data, we could identify two main strategies to legacy system modernization used in banks scaling agility, namely,
	a. wrapping 
	b. migration. 
The change outcome of each strategy in terms of an indicated degree of legacy system modernization 

Wrapping allows banks to build new interfaces to be able to communicate to the new environment without physically moving all components to this new environment. It requires less effort and resources compared to migration but it results in the lowest degree of legacy system modernization(path 1) . In banks using the wrapping strategy, the legacy system is somehow adapted to new needs but this does not involve changing the core system.

Migration allows banks to iteratively update IT system components and digital service offerings. Interestingly enough, our data indicate that some banks pursuing agility at scale aim for a partial migration strategy (path 2-1) which leads to a hybrid architecture with some components of the core system migrated to the new environment, and some still kept monolithic. This blueprint seems to refer to multi-speed IT combining the fast development of digital offerings with traditional management of core banking functions
While the partial migration strategy results in fractional legacy System modernization, some banks consider it only as an intermediary step towards a full replacement of the legacy IS (path 2-2) which, although it creates a lot of struggle, shall eventually give them intact legacy IS modernization adding business value.

Non-technical Barriers 
The second key theme identified from our analysis highlights three non-technical barriers to legacy IS modernization, namely, 
	a. missing human capital 
	b. Regulation and 
	c. ‘legacy’ culture

Missing human capital relates to the lack of know-how and skills needed for legacy system modernization. For many banks wanting to sustain their renewed digital strategies, finding software specialists with relevant skills presents a huge challenge. For instance, finding experts in COBOL - a programming language which was designed in 1959, is a real challenge nowadays since only a few universities are still teaching it.

Regulation in the banking industry hinders short-terms innovations, especially related to legacy system modernization to allow for scaling agility. This observation was clearly evident in the data as banks seem to be struggling to quickly adapt to new market needs due to regulatory restriction preventing IT related changes. This adds more complexity to bank’s compliance efforts and restrains system innovation.

"Legacy culture" describes the opposition to implementing new technologies as well as the developers' hesitation to phase out the core system. Since most developers are accustomed to working in a traditional manner and inside an established legacy culture, it might be difficult for them to adjust to novel situations. Furthermore, a lot of them see the legacy system as their own invention and are hesitant to accept critical updates to the software they developed.

Conclusion:
Through an in-depth analysis of the relevant literature, expert interviews, and case studies, this white paper has explored the significance of agility in the banking and finance industry and provided valuable insights into its implementation. The findings highlight that agility is not limited to software development but extends throughout the entire organization, enabling faster and better delivery of business objectives.
The research has revealed that agility is particularly relevant in the banking sector due to the industry's accelerating change, rapid digitization, and increasing competition from digital-native players. Moreover, the complexity and siloed nature of traditional banking institutions, combined with regulatory changes and diverse channels, necessitate the adoption of agile practices to simplify operations, foster accountability, and enhance customer experiences.
Flexibility and organizational reconfiguration are essential elements of an agile operating model. By embracing agility, banks can establish a new culture within the organization, rewiring their DNA to become nimble and customer-centric. It enables the simplification of processes, empowers front-line staff, and promotes accountability.
Additionally, attracting and retaining top digital and tech talent is crucial for banks to drive agility. To become attractive employers for the next generation of talent, banks must shed bureaucratic processes and policies and create a supportive and empowering work environment. Agile organizations are characterized by a large number of high-performing, small teams, each with a clear mission and end-to-end accountability.
The white paper also emphasizes the importance of customer-centricity in agile development. By continuously involving customers and prioritizing their needs and feedback throughout the iterative development process, banks can deliver products and services that align with customer expectations. This approach allows for the creation of minimum viable products (MVPs) that can be quickly adapted based on customer insights, resulting in faster time to market and improved customer satisfaction.
Addressing legacy systems and processes is a critical aspect of scaling agility. The white paper highlights two main strategies for legacy system modernization: wrapping and migration. While wrapping allows for new interfaces to communicate with the new environment, migration involves iteratively updating IT system components and digital service offerings. Overcoming non-technical barriers, such as missing human capital, regulatory restrictions, and a legacy culture resistant to change, is essential for successful legacy system modernization.
In conclusion, this white paper underscores the importance of agility in the banking and finance industry. By implementing agile practices, banks can adapt quickly to market changes, enhance customer experiences, attract top talent, and overcome legacy challenges. Embracing an agile operating model and fostering a customer-centric culture will position banks to thrive in the digital era, deliver innovative solutions, and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving financial landscape.
